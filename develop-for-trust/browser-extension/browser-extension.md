# Browser Extension

Interacting with a web3 wallet is typical for all websites that want to communicate with a blockchain. A web3 wallet is an application that allows users to send and receive funds and execute actions like swapping tokens in decentralized exchanges or buying NFTs on various marketplaces. Many wallets exist for different platforms (mobile/desktop/browser extension). Most browser extension wallets support EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, etc. In contrast, others support only specific blockchains like Solana, Aptos, etc.

> Trust Wallet Browser Extension currently supports only Ethereum & EVM chains, but support for more networks is in progress.
