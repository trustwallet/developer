# Pull Request Fee

Trust Wallet supports a vast number of asset and token requests. We are committed to supporting the tokens used by our users, but maintaining millions of assets comes at a significant cost — from running infrastructure and ensuring continuous integration, to handling the massive volume of asset info requests and filtering out spam and scam tokens.

To help manage this, we introduced a crypto contribution to filter out low-quality submissions and free up more time to review genuine requests. This approach was partly inspired by the concept of a Token Curated Registry.

> A fee of **500 TWT or 2.5 BNB** is required for each Pull Request. The merge-fee-bot will provide payment details once your PR is submitted. Before submitting, please review the [listing requirements](https://developer.trustwallet.com/assets/requirements).

## Why the payment?

> Due to the high volume of pull requests, maintaining the infrastructure that powers millions of assets and tokens comes at a significant cost. A modest fee is required to process each pull request, payable in cryptocurrency. This fee helps to:
> - Cover the cost of running and maintaining backend infrastructure
> - Reduce the number of spam and scam token submissions
> - Ensure smooth integration and handling of the large volume of asset requests

### How does this Fee fit with Open Source?

> - We believe in the power of open-source software, and essential parts of Trust Wallet are open source to contribute to the community (e.g., Wallet-Core). However, Trust Wallet is a branded product, and running its backend infrastructure, support, marketing, and other operations has real costs, handled by a dedicated team.
> - The assets repository is open source — you are free to use it or fork it and create your own version. But if you want your asset included in the Trust Wallet app, you must follow our guidelines, which include a contribution fee to support the maintenance of the Trust Wallet product.

### What do I have to pay attention to?

> - Always double-check the [contribution guidelines](https://developer.trustwallet.com/assets/requirements) before submitting your pull request.
> - Make sure to set the correct memo on your transfer.

## See FAQs question:

### Is crypto payment for processing my Pull Request a scam?

> No, it's not a scam!
>
> This is a legitimate request from the Trust Wallet team. However, always be cautious when someone asks you for payment. Verify that the fee is documented under the Trust Wallet Developer documentation (this page), that the repository is under the official Trust Wallet GitHub account, and that you are using the correct URL: https://assets.trustwallet.com/

### When is my payment evaluated?

> Payment is handled automatically by our bot and is typically detected within a minute.

### What happens after I pay? Is merging automatically?

> Once the bot detects your payment, it automatically places an "Accept Review" on the PR. This is a precondition for merging, but merging itself is not automatic — it is done by the maintainers.

### I forgot to set a memo in my transfer, do I have to send another payment?

> Yes. Crypto transactions are final and irreversible. Payments with missing memos or mistyped addresses cannot be recovered. Please verify all transaction details carefully before sending payment.

### If you decide not to merge my PR, do I get my payment back?

> No. The pull request fee is non-refundable and covers processing only. Payment does not guarantee that your pull request will be merged. Please review the [contribution guidelines](https://developer.trustwallet.com/assets/requirements) before paying the fee.

### Do I need to pay the PR fee again to make updates to my submission?

> Yes. If your asset is already in the repository, subsequent updates (such as name changes, logo changes, or rebranding) will require payment of the fee to cover processing.

### Can the fee be waived?

> Generally, no. Inclusions initiated and performed by our team are done without a fee, but externally submitted changes require the fee.

### What is Trust Wallet Token TWT?

> [TWT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trust-wallet-token/) is the native token of Trust Wallet, used for features such as our Referral Program. [TWT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/trust-wallet-token/) is available on BEP20 and can be obtained on several exchanges.
