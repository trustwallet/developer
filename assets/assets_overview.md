# Trust Wallet Assets Info

<center><img src='https://trustwallet.com/assets/images/media/assets/horizontal_blue.png' height="200"></center>

## Overview
The Trust Wallet Token Repository 
[https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)
is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.
[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of [other projects](#used-in-projects).

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _additions are welcome_,
primarily from token projects.

Please note that __new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863).
