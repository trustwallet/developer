## Overview
The Trust Wallet Token Repository 
[https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)
is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.
[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of [other projects](#used-in-projects).

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _additions are welcome_,
primarily from token projects.
