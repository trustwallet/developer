# Trust Wallet Assets Info

## Overview
The Trust Wallet Token Repository 
[https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)
is a comprehensive, up-to-date collection of information about several thousands (!) of crypto tokens.
[Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com) uses token logos from this source, alongside a number of [other projects](#used-in-projects).

The repository contains token info from several blockchains, info on dApps, staking validators, etc.
For every token a logo and optional additional information is available (such data is not available on-chain).

Such a large collection can be maintained only through a community effort, so _additions are welcome_,
primarily from token projects.

Please note that __new tokens are not accepted__,
the projects have to be sound, with information available, and __non-minimal circulation__
(for limit details see https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-submit-a-token-logo/3863).

## Contribution Quick Start

Details of the [repository structure](#repository-details) and 
[contribution guidelines](#contribution-guidelines) are listed below.
Here is a quick starter summary for the most common use case.

For **adding an ERC20 token**:
- fork the Github repository
- prepare a logo file, according to the [rules](#image-requirements) below, but must importantly:  PNG format, recommended pixel size of 256x256, max. 512x512, and max. file size of 100kB.
- add/upload the logo file named `logo.png` to the folder `blockchains/ethereum/assets/<contract>`,
where the last part is the token contract address in [_checksum format_](#checksum-format), such as
`blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x1234567461d3f8Db7496581774Bd869C83D51c93/logo.png`.
- Create `info.json` file with info about the token/project
- Create a PR to the main repo
- Pay the processing fee


## Repository Details

### Collections

The token repository contains the following collections:

1. [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md), ERC223 tokens on Ethereum compatible networks such as:
   [Ethereum (ETH)](https://ethereum.org/),
   [Ethereum Classic (ETC)](https://ethereumclassic.org/),
   [POA Network (POA)](https://poa.network/),
   [TomoChain (TOMO)](https://tomochain.com/),
   [GoChain (GO)](https://gochain.io/),
   [Wanchain (WAN)](https://wanchain.org/),
   [Callisto Network (CLO)](https://callisto.network/),
   [Thunder Token (TT)](https://thundercore.com/), etc.

2. [BEP2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) 
   [BEP8](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP8.md)
   Binance DEX tokens (native marketplace on Binance Chain)

3. [TRC10, TRC20](https://developers.tron.network/docs/trc10-token) tokens on TRON blockchain

4. dApp images available in `Browser` section in Trust Wallet, and bookmarks icons. [Read requirements](#dapp-image-naming-requirements). Also you can submit dApp to our list [read more](#dapp-submission-and-listing-requirements).

5. Staking validators info, such as name, image, validator id, website url. [Supported staking coins](https://trustwallet.com/staking/). [Read requirements](#staking-validators-requirements).

6. Crypto price providers map: [CoinMarketCap](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/blob/master/pricing/coinmarketcap/mapping.json)

7. Token and coin info

8. Smart contract deprecation/upgrade. [Read more](#update-and-remove-an-existing-asset).

### Repository structure

The `blockchains` folder contains several subfolders corresponding to blockchain networks, such as
`ethereum`, `binance`, etc.

The `assets` subfolder contains token folders named by smart contract address,
in [checksum format](#checksum-format) for Ethereum like networks.  
This folder should contain the `logo.png` image file, and the `info.json` file.

For other networks the address must be specified as it was originated on the chain, e.g TRON TRC10: `1002000`, TRON TRC20: `TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t` etc. 

The `info` folder contains a `logo.png` that represents the coin image.

The `validators` folder contains folders: `assets` same structure as above and `list.json` information about validators. 

The `denylist.json` and `allowlist.json`, present in some chain folders like `ethereum` and `binance`, contain list of approved tokens and banned tokens.  Trust Wallet will never show denylisted tokens, and only allowlisted tokens are shown in the token search results.

#### Checksum format
For Ethereum like networks, contract folders must be named according to the so-called **Checksum Format**, with mixed lowercase and uppercase letters, such as `0x89d24A6b4CcB1B6fAA2625fE562bDD9a23260359`.
Non-checksum addresses (e.g. all lowercase) are considered invalid.

You can find the checksum address by searching on [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io),
for example stablecoin [DAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x89d24a6b4ccb1b6faa2625fe562bdd9a23260359)
the checksum address is located at the top left corner of the page and has both uppercase and lowercase characters.
Or [convert Ethereum address to Checksum address](https://piyolab.github.io/sushiether/RunScrapboxCode/?web3=1.0.0-beta.33&code=https://scrapbox.io/api/code/sushiether/web3.js_-_Ethereum_%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%82%92%E3%83%81%E3%82%A7%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A0%E4%BB%98%E3%81%8D%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AB%E5%A4%89%E6%8F%9B%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B/demo.js).

## Contribution Guidelines

### Contribution Use Cases

#### Add new asset

1. Prepare asset, look at [image requirements](#image-requirements), [dapp requirements](#dapp-image-naming-requirements). 
2. Get familiar with our [folder structure](#repository-structure), it will give you an understanding where assets should be placed
3. [Add asset guide](#how-to-add-files)
4. Pay the merge [fee](#fee)

#### Update and remove an existing asset

Whenever you updating or deleting an asset on behalf of the asset owner or just found outdated information, please provide a link to the source saying about changes. That will help to speed up the review process.

This instruction wil be helpfull if you want to:

1. Update information about the smart contract

2. [Deprecate](#what-is-smart-contract-deprecation) or update contract address

Smart contract address update procedure:

1. Rename old contract address in coresponding coin folder to new contract e.g.:

1. Remove smart contract e.g.:

```bash
`rm -r ./blockchains/<COIN>/assets/<OLD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>/`

`rm -r ./blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x19fFfd124CD9089E21026d10dA97f8cD6B442Bff/`
```
2. Commit changes and make a PR (pull request)

### Image Requirements
- File location: must be placed in the correct folder and subfolder within the [folder structure](#repository-structure).
- File extension: `png`. Uppercase `PNG` is considered invalid.
- File name：`logo.png`, all lowercase.
- Dimension: `256 x 256 pixels` or `512 x 512 pixels`.
- Background: Avoid transparency, set background as your brand color or white by default otherwise your token image wont look good on white/dark theme design.
- File size: maximum 100kB.  Tip: optimize image size, e.g. using simple drag-and-drop online service [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/).

### Info.json Contents

The `info.json` file contains basic information about the token/project.

It has following required fields:
- `name`: name of the token
- `type`: such as ERC20, BEP2, BEP20, TRC20, TRC10, ...
- `symbol`: the token symbol
- `decimals`: number of decimal digits used in the amounts (e.g. 18 for ETH)
- `description`: a few sentence summary of the token/project
- `website`: project web site
- `explorer`: URL of the token explorer page
- `id`: the id/contract/address of the token, same as the subfolder name

And optionally:
- `links`: Optional array with `name`/`url` pairs, for social media links, documentation, etc.
List of currently supported types:
`github`, `whitepaper`, `twitter`, `telegram`, `telegram_news`, `medium`, `discord`, `reddit`, `facebook`, `youtube`, `coinmarketcap`, `coingecko`, `blog`, `forum`, `docs`, `source_code`.
Note: the `socials` section is no longer used.

If in doubt about fields, look around / search in existing info.json files.

Sample `info.json`:

```
{
    "name": "Trust Wallet Token",
    "website": "https://trustwallet.com",
    "description": "Utility token to increase adoption of cryptocurrency.",

### How To Add Files
If you are not familiar with GitHub or Git, the process of adding new tokens may look complicated at first glance, but it consists of only a few steps, and is not very complicated.

#### Basics, Prerequisites

The assets repository is maintained in [GitHub](https://github.com), the largest hosting for open source projects.
You need a GitHub account to interact with it.

To do changes in the assets repository, you need to create a personal copy called a _fork_.

Once the changes are prepared inside the fork, you need to create a _pull request_ to the main repository.
Upon review the maintainers will accept your pull request, and the changes will be incorporated.

#### Adding files using GitHub web page
1. Proceed to [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)
2. Press on `Fork` in the top right corner, wait for process to complete.
   Note: if you already have a fork, it should be updated: easiest is to remove the fork and create it afresh.
3. Navigate to desire chain folder you want to add asset
4. Prepare on your local drive a folder corresponding to the token cortact.
5. Copy the logo image as `logo.png` into the folder (and optional info file).
6. Simply drag and drop the folder to active window
7. In `Commit changes` box:
  - `Add files via upload` add meaningfull comment what you adding to the repo
  - optional: In `Add an optional extended description` write a comment about upload
  - optional: adjust fork branch name
8. Click on `Propose changes`
9. Press on `Create pull request`

#### Adding files using GitHub Desktop application
The steps are similar to using the web page, but the desktop app has more control for overwriting the files, branching, pushing.

#### Adding files using command-line
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone fork and create new branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_HANDLE/assets.git
cd assets
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

3. Add asset to appropriate directory, the [folder strcture](#repository-structure) documentation will help you
4. Commit and push to your fork

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m “Add <token_name>”
git push origin <branch_name>
```

5. From your repo clone page make a new PR (pull request)

### Fee
Due to an increasing number of pull request (and proportional checking & merging effort),
a modest fee is required for processing a pull request, payable in cryptocurrency.
Follow the instructions in the pull request for completing the fee payment.

See the [fee FAQ](pr-fee.md)


## FAQ
### Why is the build on my pull request red?
Contributions in a pull request are verified by an automated build.
The checks fail if something is wrong, like to logo is too large or an Ethereum contract is not in
[checksum format](#checksum-format).
Checks the exact error message in the build to find out the problem.

### Why is there a merge conflict in my pull request?
A merge conflict happens if the same file has been modified in the pull request, and also in the master branch since the fork was created.  With assets repo, this typically caused by using a fork that was created long ago.
The simplest solution in this case is to delete your pull request, delete your fork, create a new fork, and create a new PR.  Alternatively, a merge conflict can be resolved using git command line, but Git skills are required.
A pull request can also happen when overriding an existing logo.

### Why I don't see my token in search after PR was merged?
After PR was merged, it may take some time, but not longer than one hour, until search will show the new logo.

### Why do I still see old logo in Trust Wallet after uploaded new one?
Both clients, Android and iOS keep old image cache for up to a few days. In order to see changes immediately, reinstall Trust Wallet. But as always, make sure you have a backup of all your wallets.

### What is smart contract deprecation?
A process of removing smart contract information such as (token logo and info) from this repository.
Removed contract address will be added to the denylist and, as a result, will no longer be present in token search results inside the TW app.
Why would you want to do this ?.
You are contract owner or just good samaritan who noticed contract to be no longer "active" and was an upgrade and abandoned by owning organization, involved in a scam, mimicking by its name or/and symbol a real contract. All facts must be supported with a link to any resource proving these statements.

## Token Status

`active` - Token meets the standard requirements in circulation (number of holders and transactions).

`spam` - Token that is distribtued to a large number of recepients that have no inherent value or has been verified as a dishonest scheme or fraud.

`abandoned` - Token with very low activity (below 100 token transfers a year), migrated to mainnet or to a new contract.

No longer active
