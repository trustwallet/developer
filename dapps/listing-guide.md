# A Complete Guide to Listing your dApp with Trust Wallet

Joining the Trust Wallet ecosystem with an already established base of users, projects, and communities is a great opportunity for your dApp project to leapfrog its growth. Before you can be listed alongside the other top dApps partnered with Trust Wallet, there is a documented process that needs to be carefully followed and completed.

Trust Wallet is proud of the high standards of quality required for listed dApps, where the user and their experience are the key areas of focus. The app is one of the most popular wallets available for easy access to digital assets and dApps in one place.

By improving the functionality of your project and its overall optimization, you allow users already familiar with the Trust Wallet space the best chance of using your dApp. Taking advantage of the vibrant [community](https://twitter.com/TrustWallet) is a logical step to take.

### Applying for the Trust Wallet dApp Listing

Adding your dApp to the official Trust Wallet listing provides users with a guarantee of the quality and service provided by your dApp. Not every project that is submitted to the listing is approved. _Upon review, a member of the Trust Wallet team will reach out with additional information or follow up questions if necessary_.

Trust Wallet is proud of the standards set in place to ensure that only the best projects are presented. Once you’ve applied, a member of the Trust Wallet team will reach out should we feel your app is a good candidate based on UX, mobile optimization, responsiveness, value proposition relative to other apps, etc.

The aim of the Trust Wallet dApp Directory is twofold:

1. It empowers users to discover high-quality dApps within Trust Wallet.
2. It allows developers to showcase their work to millions of users as part of a developed and supported ecosystem.

#### Curation Guidelines

dApp listing submissions are considered on a case-by-case basis. While there isn’t a strict formula that dictates which apps we decide to list, the safety and experience of our users are of the utmost importance to us. For that reason, the dApp Directory is curated with the following set of guidelines:

- We believe the dApp ecosystem should be open and allow for the expression of diverse ideas and opinions. dApp submissions with content or behavior that fails to meet a “common sense” bar for respecting different ideas or users will be rejected.
- Attempts to misrepresent or otherwise deceive the listing and review process will result in your dApp being rejected or delisted from the directory.
- Stronger consideration will be given to dApps that demonstrate a unique value proposition relative to other existing/popular apps
- Good design is a critical component to increasing the accessibility of crypto and Defi. We look for dApps that scale gracefully across screen sizes and devices, and appropriate management of complex user flows through thoughtful UI

Before submitting your dApp and filling out the submission form, you should ensure that your dApp is fully compliant with our submission criteria.

You are responsible for the use of ad networks, analytics services, and third-party SDKs used within your dApp, so review and choose them carefully.

#### Safety and Security

Trust Wallet users require confidence that using dApps won’t jeopardize their funds, personal information, or device security.

Additionally, dApps that contain malware are strictly prohibited. This includes any functionality that seeks to gain or provide unauthorized access or control to a user’s device.

#### Objectionable and misleading content

Trust Wallet will reject any dApp submitted for listing that contains or promotes spam, violence, pornography, fake news, or other inappropriate content not suitable for a decentralized application.

#### Legal & Business

Ensure that your dApp is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations where you plan on making it available. dApps that encourage or solicit criminal or reckless behavior will not be tolerated and may result in notifying law enforcement.
