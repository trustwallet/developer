## Introduction

Trust Wallet Core is a cross-platform library that implements low-level cryptographic wallet functionality for many blockchains. Most of the code is C++ with a set of strict exported C interfaces. The library provides idiomatic interfaces for all supported languages \(currently Swift for iOS and Java for Android\).

## Usage

If you want to use wallet core in your project follow these instructions:

* For building locally, or using Docker image, see the [Build Instructions](building.md).
* For trying out, e.g. testing key management and address derivation, see the [WalletConsole utility](walletconsole.md).
* If you want to include Wallet Core in your project, see the [Integration Guides](integration-guide.md).
Start with the overview of the most common wallet operations ([Usage Guide](wallet-core-usage.md)),
and see the platform-specifc guides for 
[iOS](ios-guide.md) and
[Android](android-guide.md).
* We have a [FAQ](faq.md) list may already answer some of your questions.
