# Wallet Core Integration Guide

This Integration Guide is intended for developers building on top of Wallet Core. Typical projects using Wallet Core are _mobile wallets_ -- iOS and/or Android apps, and potentially desktop wallets.
Wallet Core functionality can prove to be helpful in some backend-side projects as well.

The guide has the following outline:

- [Wallet Core Usage Guide](wallet-core-usage.md).
  In this general guide we describe the basic wallet operations (_wallet creation_, _address derivation_, _transaction signing_) in detail, with some code examples. This is recommended first.

- [iOS Integration Guide](ios-guide.md).
  This is a walkthrough of a sample iOS wallet application.

- [Android Integration Guide](android-guide.md).
  This is a walkthrough of a sample Android wallet application.

- [Server-Side GoLang Guide](server-side.md).
  Here we provide instructions on how to integrate Wallet Core into a _Go_ languge backend-side project.
