# Contributing

We want to make Trust Wallet Core as good as it can be. If you want to contribute your help is greatly appreciated. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about blockchain technology and improve Trust Wallet. To make the process as smooth as possible please read this document and follow our guidelines. We are happy to review your code but please ensure that you have a [clean pull request](contributing.md#pull-requests).

Wallet Core implements the cryptographic functionality of blockchains. This includes elliptic curve cryptography, hashing, address derivation and transaction signing. However it _does not_ implement other aspects like networking and UI. Wallet core behaves like a black box for higher level users like Trust Wallet; it takes inputs from the blockchain and the user \(for instance UTXOs, private keys, etc.\) and produces an output \(like a signed and encoded transaction\). Keep this in mind when adding functionality.

This is a diagram representing how Trust Wallet interacts with Trust Wallet Core.

## Library Design Guidelines

This library is designed so that it can be used from any other programming languages, and that every language has an idiomatic interface. Design goals also include minimizing the binary size and maximizing performance.

With these goals in mind we chose C/C++ for the implementation and a strict subset of C for the interface. This C interface is used to generate the idiomatic interfaces for every supported language. To augment the expressivity of the interface we also use Protocol Buffer objects that get serialized across the interface.

Keep this in mind when adding to the library:

- Only expose C headers. Clients should not have access to the C++ interfaces.
- C headers need to have annotations for the code generation tool, see below.
- Use Protocol Buffers to represent models. C doesn't have good abstractions for variable-sized types.
- Every time you modify the interface run the code generation tool and make sure the interface also makes sense in target languages.

There is a [Sourcetrail](https://github.com/CoatiSoftware/Sourcetrail) [project file](https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/blob/master/wallet_core.srctrlprj) might help you explore all the code (after build and run `bootstrap.sh`).

## Pull Requests

Please follow these instructions when submitting a pull request \(PR\):

- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the official repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from the latest `upstream/master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation. Use `clang-format` if you are unsure.
- Run the tests.
- Modify your commit history so that it tells a story using git's [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code, not what you did to the code.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `master` branch.
- If we request further changes push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete

  your extra branch\(es\).

Is it not uncommon for a PR to accumulate commits and merges with time. The library is in constant change. If your PR falls out of sync with the upstream master you need to rebase. We can't reliably review code that is spread over too many other changes to the codebase. Please use git's [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) and if necessary create a new PR.

- The `samples` folder contains sample applications.

## Prerequisites and Building

Please refer to [build instructions](building.md) for building the library locally.

## Testing

After running `bootstrap.sh` run `make -C build tests && build/tests/tests tests` to run all the C++ unit tests. To run integration tests on each platform run the respective script in the tools folder:

- Android: run `tools/android-test` or import `android` folder to Android Studio
- iOS: run `tools/ios-test` or cd `swift` folder and open `TrustWalletCore.xcworkspace`

To run all tests in one go use the `tools/tests` script.

## C Headers

The wallet core code generator parses C headers for class and struct definitions. Headers need to be in the `include/TrustWalletCode` folder and start with the `TW` prefix followed by the class or sturct name. Inside each header file there needs to be exactly one class or struct defition.

A class definition starts with the `TW_EXPORT_CLASS` macro followed by a forward-declared struct. For example:

```c
TW_EXPORT_CLASS
struct TWPrivateKey;
```

Similarly, a struct definition start with the `TW_EXPORT_STRUCT` macro followed by an inline-declared struct. For example:

```c
TW_EXPORT_STRUCT
struct TWPublicKey {
    uint8_t bytes[TWPublicKeyUncompressedSize];
};
```

You can also define enumerations using the `TW_EXPORT_ENUM()` macro:

```text
TW_EXPORT_ENUM(uint32_t)
enum TWCoinType {
    TWCoinTypeBitcoin = 0,
};
```

After the class or struct definition you can declare as many methods and properties as necessary. There are four types of declarations: static method, static property, method, and property. Each is declared by `TW_EXPORT_STATIC_METHOD`, `TW_EXPORT_STATIC_PROPERTY`, `TW_EXPORT_METHOD`, and `TW_EXPORT_PROPERTY` respectively. Each method or property name needs to start with the type name. For instance `TWPublicKeyIsValid` gets translated to the `isValid` property in the `PublicKey` type.

The types that methods can take and return are restricted to: `bool`, `int`, `size_t`, `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`, `TWData`, `TWString`, and any defined classses, structs or enums.

Methods always take the type as their first argument. The type needs to be a pointer if the type is a class and a struct if the type is a struct. Properties need to take the type as its only argument.

Static property declarations can take no arguments. Static methods can take any arguments.

Since C interface doesn't know how to handle C++ exception, we should catch all possible exceptions in the C implementation.

## Coin definition

The wallet core code generator also parses coin configuration defined in `registry.json`, the generated code will be located at `src/Generated/Coins.cpp`.
See the documentation of the fields here: https://github.com/trustwallet/wallet-core/blob/master/docs/registry-fields.md.

Example:

```json

  "id": "bitcoin",
  "name": "Bitcoin",
  "coinId": 0,
  "symbol": "BTC",
  "decimals": 8,
  "blockchain": "Bitcoin",

    },
    {

    "rpc": "",
    "documentation": "https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/blob/master/docs/api.md"
  }
}
```

## Protocol Buffers

Since the C language doesn't provide good abstractions for variable-sized arrays and strings, the C interface uses [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). All models are defined in the `src/proto` folder. These models can then be used in the C interface by using the proto model name with underscores. For instance `TW_Binance_Proto_SigningInput`.

The proto file will be used to generate C++ classes and also classes in each supported client language \(Swift, Java, etc.\). The code generator will also generate the protobuf serialization code so that library clients don't have to worry about serialization. To generate the Protocol Buffers code run the `tools/generate-files` script when you modify the `src/TrustWalletCore.proto` file.

## Code Style

Wallet core follows the [LLVM Coding Standards](http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) for C++. We use `clang-format` to ensure a consistent code sytle. **Do not** reformat files that you didn't modify, or the header files in the `include` folder. You can install a clang-format extension for your IDE.
